			<hr>
			<p>I'm an amateur software developer. I am trying to find a career in the IT world.</p>
			<p>Throughout the years I have also found myself interested in tons of other topics, including video
				production, web design, game dev and design, and mechanical engineering.</p>

			<h3>I currently drive a 2008 Honda Accord Coupe EX-L V6 with a 6-speed manual transmission.</h3>
			<p>It is absolutely bone-stock; this is pretty much my dream car. The only features I'd want that it doesn't
				have are a backup camera and CarPlay, neither of which are killer features, especially in a 2008.</p>
