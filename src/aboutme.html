			<h1>Hey, I'm Luke!</h1>
			<h6>also known as Vresod</h6>
			<hr>
			<p>I'm an amateur software developer, trying to find a career in the IT world.</p>
			<p class="text-balancewrap">Throughout the years I have also found myself interested in tons of other
				topics, including video production, web design, game dev and design, and mechanical engineering;I
				generally like to think of myself as a tinkerer.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>On this page, you can get an idea of some of the things I'm interested in.</p>

			<h3>One of the things I'm passionate about is cars.</h3>
			<p class="text-balancewrap">I got my driver's license in September of 2023; since then, I have been
				ravenously learning and studying their operation. You can think of this is as an extension of my general
				curiosity about "how things work".</p>
			<p>I've learned how to drive a manual transmission, <i>which is uncommon in America</i>, and prefer it over
				automatic.</p>
